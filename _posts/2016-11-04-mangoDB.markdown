Today some common threads came up for me again in my approach to debugging
stuff. A friend who was running a mongo instance for a little test app from
some time ago came to me and asked me to (amongst other things) tell her where
the document store was on the filesystem so she could back it up.

Having previously rescued her install during the day (don't ask, fucking Mongo)
from some lovely "features", my brain skipped looking in the config file for
reasons of trust and straight to:

```bash
sudo lsof -p $(pidof mongod)
```

This belies my intense distrust of some userland programs: I don't care what YOU
think you're doing, I'm asking the kernel.

We also had a talk today at work about Unix dynamic linking, in which
`/proc/<pid>/maps` came up again. This brought me back to the fun "feature" of
apt in which it restarts a list of assumed dependent services for a given shared
library when it upgrades, but they're by no means exhaustive so you can think
that you've mitigated some CVE related to libpam when in actuality half of the
dependent daemons still have the old version mmapped.

My shonky script to demonstrate this is:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
[ -z "$1" ] && exit 2

library_regex="$@"

mapped_deleted=""
while read process; do 
  pid=$(echo $process | awk '{print $1}')
  cmd=$(echo $process | awk '{print $2}')
  map=$(sudo grep -E "$library_regex" /proc/$pid/maps 2>/dev/null)
  if ! [ "$map" = "" ]; then
    echo -e "\n${process}\n------------"
    echo "$map"
    if echo "$map" | grep -q "(deleted)"; then
      mapped_deleted="$mapped_deleted\n$cmd"
    fi
  fi
done< <(ps --no-header -eo pid,comm)

if [ "$mapped_deleted" = "" ]; then
  exit 1
else
  echo
  echo "NEEDS RESTART"
  echo -n "============="
  echo -e "$mapped_deleted" | sort | uniq
  exit 0
fi
```

Just another argument for high reboot churn and trusting userland about as far
as you can throw it :)

I think the worst kinds of misfeatures are the ones that make you think you're
doing your due dilligence when in actuality they're just giving you a false
sense of security.
