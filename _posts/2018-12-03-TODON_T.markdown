I've recently been playing around with [joplin](joplin) as a notebook and TODO
manager. I initially looked at it because I'd been kind-of using org-mode and an
associated iOS app but finding that it was a little too flexible and let me lose
my `.org` files or create a convoluted mess of a document hierarchy. The app was
pretty shit too.

Joplin is nice because it's simple - you have a number of workbooks, and you
create todos and notes in markdown format. You can sync via dropbox (so no cloud
service, no signup) , and the killer feature for me is the terminal app.

But life's never easy and when I went to build from AUR the fucking build was
failing on some Electron nonsense. Both the Electron and terminal apps are
bundled in together, and I really don't care for the former, so I managed to fix
it all by removing it from the PKGBUILD:

Makes me glad I have a build container to keep all the build trash off my main
environment!
