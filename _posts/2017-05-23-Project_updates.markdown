It's been a little while since I updated with anything but I've actually made a
fair amount of progress with several projects:

1. The [grimmplayer][grimmplayer] now has a case (an old Amber Leaf tobacco tin
   that I found) and a power switch.
2. I [fixed][planck] my Planck keyboard, so that's back in regular circulation
3. I've been writing and using an RSS "reconstituter" which will take feeds
   which truncate the article body and rebuild them with a scrape of the
   original article
4. I've installed [OpenWRT][openwrt] on a [TP-Link TLMR3020][tplink] portable
   wifi router and have it acting as an intermediate hotspot so that I can build
   in captive portal autofill and TCP mode OpenVPN for badly behaved public wifi

I also did a talk at work on keyboards that I did the slides for in
[remark.js][remark] which I learned a bunch of CSS from, which has been fun
along with the CSS selectors I've been learning to use in my scraping
adventures.

Hopefully I'll update on some more of the specifics of the above soon :)
