So I've been hanging out a lot in #n-o-d-e on irc.freenode.net (which is the irc
channel for the ever excellent [n-o-d-e][n-o-d-e] and [tj] who
frequents the channel has been shaming the rest of us with his
[blogging][adventurist] by just blogging cool shit as he goes along. Well I for
one will not stand for it.

I'm going to copy him.

So I'm finally getting round to blogging some of my own shit hopefully in a
useful and interesting way. Or some shit.
